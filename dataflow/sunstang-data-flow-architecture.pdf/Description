How it works:
- There are 2 implementations that will be constantly sending data at some rate: LTE/3G and serial communication (us)

1) For the LTE implementation, the Raspberry Pi on the Sunstang car will pull data from the CAN bus and send it to a local database.
The database will compile all of the data into a document and send it to the cloud where it can be accessed remotely.

2) For the serial implementation, the Arduino will pull data from the CAN bus and send it through the modems to the secondary location.
The Raspberry Pi will then receive the info and then make it available to be seen locally as well as to a local database.
Like before, the local database will compile/send the data up to the cloud.

- The documents will be timestamped so if the cloud server receives 2 docs with the same time, it will accept the first doc and disregard
the second

- If one method happens to fail (i.e. lose connection), we should still have the other method available to keep sending data to the cloud.
